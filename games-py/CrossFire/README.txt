Running the Game
----------------
In Linux open a terminal and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.py" file and double-click it.

Whichever OS you use, you will need Python 2.5+ (no Python 3.x support yet, sorry) and PyGame 1.9+). These can be obtained from http://python.org and http://pygame.org respectively.


How to Play the Game
--------------------
Blast the invading alien scum to bits with your two trusty drone weapons. You control both at once, using the left and right cursor keys to control the bottom drone, and the up and down cursor keys to control the side drone. 'Z' fires the bottom drone's weapon and 'X' fires the other.

You have a shield that can take 9 direct hits either from an attacking alien or one of their lazer blasts.

There are 9 waves of aliens to show just who is boss. 

Good luck.
